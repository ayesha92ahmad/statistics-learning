  1.1: Core Programming concepts<br>
      https://docs.python.org/2.7/<br>
      https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/<br>
  1.2: Challenges online<br>
  1.3: Essential data science libraries<br>
        1.3.1: NumPy - NumPy is the grand-daddy of all data science libraries. It allows easy and efficient numeric       computation, and many other machine learning libraries are built on top of it.<br>
        1.3.2: Pandas - Pandas is high-performance library for data structures and exploratory analysis.<br>
        1.3.3: Matplotlib - Flexible plotting and visualization library.<br>
        1.3.4: IPython - Interactive shell for Python that makes it much easier to explore data and debug errors. Makes it much more enjoyable to learn Python for data science.<br>
        1.3.5: SciPy - Extends NumPy with more functionality, such as calculating integrals, linear algebra, and statistics.<br>
