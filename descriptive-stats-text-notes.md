<h1>Descriptive Stats</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Constructs- something for which a way to measure has not been found. Eg. happiness, hunger, etc

Operational definition:
A way of turning constructs into variables we can measure.

Lurking variables
correlation does not prove causation

Show relationships => observational studies surveys

Show causation => controlled experiment
Different kinds of studies:
observational studies
surveys
Experiments


Surveys:
why surveys?
Easy
inexpensive
conducted remotely
anyone can access and analyze survey results
timeless

downfalls:
untruthful responses
biased responses
respondents not understanding the question
respondents refusing to answer the question

Experiments:
random sample

blinding- 
placebo- fake treatment

single blind- participatants
double blind- researcher and participants are unaware

<h3>Visualization Techniques</h3>

Google spreadsheet tutorial:

Forulae:
  - SUM(a2:a8)
  - Average(a2:a8)
  - Deviation: distance from the mean: a2-$E$1 (so that it remains constant if we copy paste)
  - Variance: sum of squared deviation divided by number of entries
  - Standard deviation(sigma): square root of variance

Central Tendency:

Mode - Value where frequency is highest

Median - Value where frequency is in the middle

Mean - Average value
---
Mode
Mode of distribution - Range that occured with highest frequency
Mode of negatively skewed distribution - ""
Mode of Uniform distribution - No mode
Multimodal - More than one mode

- The mode occurs on the X-axis, so you are looking for whatever value has the highest frequency
- The mode can be used to describe any kind of data
- All scores do not affect the mode
- There is no equation for the mode
- If we take different samples of the same dataset we will get different modes
- If we take different bin size mode changes
