<h1>Descriptive Stats</h1>

## <h3>Introduction</h3>
Constructs- something for which a way to measure has not been found. Eg. happiness, hunger, etc

Operational definition:
A way of turning constructs into variables we can measure.

Lurking variables
correlation does not prove causation

Show relationships => observational studies surveys

Show causation => controlled experiment
Different kinds of studies:
observational studies
surveys
Experiments


## Surveys
why surveys?
Easy
inexpensive
conducted remotely
anyone can access and analyze survey results
timeless

downfalls:
untruthful responses
biased responses
respondents not understanding the question
respondents refusing to answer the question

Experiments:
random sample

blinding- 
placebo- fake treatment

single blind- participatants
double blind- researcher and participants are unaware

## <h3>Visualization Techniques</h3>

Google spreadsheet tutorial:

Forulae:
  - SUM(a2:a8)
  - Average(a2:a8)
  - Deviation: distance from the mean: a2-$E$1 (so that it remains constant if we copy paste)
  - Variance: sum of squared deviation divided by number of entries
  - Standard deviation(sigma): square root of variance

---
## Central Tendency

Mode : Value where frequency is highest

Median : Value where frequency is in the middle

Mean : Average value

---

## <h4>Mode</h4>
Mode of distribution - Range that occured with highest frequency

Mode of negatively skewed distribution - ""

Mode of Uniform distribution - No mode

Multimodal - More than one mode

- The mode occurs on the X-axis, so you are looking for whatever value has the highest frequency
- The mode can be used to describe any kind of data
- All scores do not affect the mode
- There is no equation for the mode
- If we take different samples of the same dataset we will get different modes
- If we take different bin size mode changes

## <h4>Mean</h4>
mean = sum/frequency

Properties:
- All scores in the distribution affect the mean
- Mean from different samples in the population may have similarmeans
- Extreme values will change the mean
- Mean with Outliers are misleading

## <h4>Median</h4>

Middle of the data
Useful info from data is arrange in order.
